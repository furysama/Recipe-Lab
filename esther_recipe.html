			<h2>Banana Chocolate Chip Muffins (With Heath Bits)</h2>
			<p>
				I tend to bake when I need something to do that keeps me busy and helps
				to work off stress. It is nice to listen to a podcast, do the methodical
				tasks of ingredient prep and mixing, and appear to be doing something
				busy and important so that the kids ask dad for help instead of me for a
				while! It helps if they want to eat the end results. And I don't mind
				the bonus of having a treat at the end, either!
